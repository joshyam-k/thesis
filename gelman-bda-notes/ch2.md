## General Notes:

The central feature of Bayesian inference, the direct quantification of uncertainty, means that there is no impediment in principle to fitting models with many parameters and complicated multilayered probability specifications. This freedom to set up complex models arises in large part from the fact that the Bayesian paradigm provides a conceptually simple method for coping with multiple parameters.

Throughout this book $\theta$ denotes unobservable vector quantities or population *parameters* of interest, $y$ denotes the observed data, and $\tilde{y}$ denote the unknown, but potentially observable, quantities.

$p(\cdot)$ represents a marginal distribution and $Pr(\cdot)$ represents the probability of an event.
