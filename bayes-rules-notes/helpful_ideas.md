### Don't be too stubborn

A posterior model is defined on the same values for which the prior is defined. In other words, the support of the posterior is inherited from the prior. Thus a prior should *always* assign a non-zero plausibility to every possible value of {$\theta$}. Failing to do so could "block" your posterior from every approaching a logical distribution with the accrual of more data.
