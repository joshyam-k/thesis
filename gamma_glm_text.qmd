## Gamma GLM

Normally we write the PDF of a gamma distribution with shape and rate parameters as

$$
f(y) = \frac{\beta^{\alpha}}{\Gamma(\alpha)}y^{\alpha - 1}e^{-\beta y}
$$
which has mean $E[y] = \frac{\alpha}{\beta}$ and variance $Var(y) = \frac{\alpha}{\beta^2}$

We can reparametrize by $(\mu, \alpha)$ we obtain

$$
f(y) = \frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)}\bigg(\frac{\alpha}{\mu}\bigg)^{\alpha}y^{\alpha-1}e^{-\frac{\alpha}{\mu}y}
$$
which has mean $E[y] = \mu$ and variance $Var(y) = \frac{\mu^2}{\alpha}$

Now when we build a gamma generalized linear model we often assume that the shape parameter is constant across all of our values, and it is the mean parameter that varies

$$
y_i \sim Gamma(\mu_i, \alpha)
$$
